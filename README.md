# Crop-Production-Statistics-in-India

This repository contains the code and data for performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on crop statistics of India. 
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insights and understanding of the crop production trends and patterns in India.

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from **https://www.kaggle.com/**. 
It includes information about crop production, area harvested, and yield of various crops across different states in India. 
The dataset covers multiple years and provides a comprehensive view of the agricultural landscape in the country.

**Files**

**APY.csv:** 

This is the main dataset file in CSV format containing the crop statistics of India. 
It includes columns such as crop name, state, year, area harvested, production, and yield.

**EDA.ipynb**: 

This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for performing the exploratory data analysis.
It covers various aspects of data exploration, visualization, and basic statistical analysis.

**Results**

The results of this analysis can be found in the **EDA.ipynb** notebook. 
The visualizations and key findings help in understanding the crop production trends, regional variations, and the overall agricultural landscape in India.

**Future Work**

This EDA serves as a starting point for further in-depth analysis and modeling. Possible areas for future work include:

1. Advanced statistical modelling to predict crop yields and production based on historical data and external factors like weather conditions.
  
2. Clustering analysis to identify groups of states with similar crop patterns and production characteristics.
   
3. Time series analysis to forecast future crop production trends and assess the impact of agricultural policies.
